            The <em>Col&eacute;gio do Esp&iacute;rito Santo</em>
            is a monument full of history and details of great interest. 
            It is a Jesuit inspired building, which was founded in the sixteenth century.
            The main cloister's classrooms are decorated with baroque tiles,
            alluding to subjects that were taught there, at that time.
            In the library's ancient room, we can find a ceiling painted in the early 18th century.
