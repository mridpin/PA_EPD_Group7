                    implementation, session time per user increased by 39% and daily views per user
                    by 15%.

                    Voot is one of India's top video-on-demand products, available as both a native
                    app and a mobile web app. It offers close to 35,000 hours of premium content
                    online, including exclusive shows from networks such as Colors and MTV, as well
                    as Voot Originals and over 8,000 videos for children. Voot is run by Viacom18, a
                    joint venture between Viacom and Network18 Group.

                    Mobile devices are a primary form of media consumption in India. Such devices
                    often have limited storage for native apps, making the mobile web a critical
                    part of the Voot product strategy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most mobile Voot users access the Internet via metered 2G and 3G networks. Data
                    transfer is expensive, and while users become highly committed to a video once
                    it starts playing, slow load times lead to users giving up before the experience
                    can even start. To address that challenge and increase mobile web usage, Voot
                    looked to enhance their site with Progressive Web App features.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    To improve the overall user experience, Voot.com turned their site into a
                    Progressive Web App, using features such as Add to Homescreen and a service
                    worker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While 4G services have recently launched, most users in India
                    reach the Internet via 2G and 3G networks, with slow and sometimes
                    expensive data transfer rates. To reduce the data being transferred, Voot.com
                    optimized their images specifically for mobile, and the
                    site now dynamically serves either JPEG or WebP images depending upon browser
                    capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Voot.com also decreased load times by adding a service worker to preload images
                    as the user navigates, and to cache images for repeat visits. The site was also
                    analyzed with <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse</a> to gain performance insights,
                    which in turn allowed a reduction in JavaScript and CSS overhead and the
                    implementation of synchronous server calls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These optimizations resulted in a 63% reduction in first-view page load data
                    transfer and an 86% reduction in data transfer for returning visitors. Page
                    loads became 5 times faster for first-time visitors, and almost 7 times faster
                    for returning users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To offer a true app-like experience, Voot.com also implemented
                    <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners">add to home screen</a>,
                    allowing users to launch the page from their home screen like a native app. This
                    combined with a streamlined login process allows users to quickly and easily
                    re-engage with the site and watch their favorite shows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Voot launched its new UI first on mobile web, ahead of desktop web and native
                    app. Within days of launch, the improvements translated to a 19% reduction in
                    user abandonment and a 77% increase in conversion from visitor to video viewer.
                    Users also showed higher levels of engagement, with a 39% increase in average
                    user session time and a 15% increase in average daily video views per user.
                    These user engagement metrics show Voot.com performing similarly to the native
                    app, without requiring the user to install anything.

                    "We have moved the needle very significantly when it comes to user experience
                    on the Mobile Web by adopting PWA” says Rajneel Kumar, SVP - Head of Product
                    and Technology for OTT and Digital Ventures at Viacom18. “All the time and
                    effort we’ve spent on technology and UI changes as well as optimizations seem
                    to be showing very positive results. We are going to continue to refine this
                    further and we are confident that we will continue to see significant consumer
                    lift.”
