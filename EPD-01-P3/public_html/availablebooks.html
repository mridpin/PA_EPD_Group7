                    <figcaption><strong>The Divine Comedy</strong> is a long narrative poem by <strong>Dante Alighieri</strong>, begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year 
                        before his death in 1321. It is widely considered the preeminent work in Italian literature, and is seen as one 
                        of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of 
                        the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the 
                        Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language.  It is divided into three parts: 
                        Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso.<br>

                        <strong>It</strong> is a 1986 horror novel by American author <strong>Stephen King</strong>. It was his 22nd book and 18th novel written under his own name. 
                        The story follows the experiences of seven children as they are terrorized by a being that exploits the fears and phobias 
                        of its victims to disguise itself while hunting its prey. "It" primarily appears in the form of a clown to attract its 
                        preferred prey of young children. The novel is told through narratives alternating between two time periods, and is largely 
                        told in the third-person omniscient mode. It deals with themes that eventually became King staples: the power of memory, 
                        childhood trauma and its recurrent echoes in adulthood, the ugliness lurking behind a fa&&ccedil;ade of small-town quaintness, and 
                        overcoming evil through mutual trust and sacrifice.

                        <strong>The Da Vinci Code</strong> is a 2003 mystery-detective novel by <strong>Dan Brown</strong>. It follows symbologist Robert Langdon and cryptologist 
                        Sophie Neveu after a murder in the Louvre Museum in Paris, when they become involved in a battle between the Priory of 
                        Sion and Opus Dei over the possibility of Jesus Christ having been a companion to Mary Magdalene. The title of the novel 
                        refers, among other things, to the finding of the first murder victim in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre, naked and posed 
                        similar to Leonardo da Vinci's famous drawing, the Vitruvian Man, with a cryptic message written beside his body and a 
                        pentacle drawn on his chest in his own blood.
