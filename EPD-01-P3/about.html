            Students want to meet with people who like the same kind of books as them, get to know them and have enriching conversations
            with one another, so in 2011 Pablo de Olavide University created this social club so that students can get together and
            discuss their favorite books. We achieve to create a friendly enviroment for students and we listen to your every coment to make
            this reading club better so if you have any questions or suggestions you can send them to us in the box below.
